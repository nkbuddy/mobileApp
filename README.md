# mobileApp

I built a parking app and decided to use the Dart and the Flutter SDK and presented every week using different UML diagrams to explore different aspects of the project. Learned to combine different codebases of multiple GitHub projects, implementing Google Maps API and de-compiling the citizen app apk file to see the source code.
